  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  Occupational licenses cover nearly one-fifth of the U.S. workforce. This paper studies their impact on the gender wage gap. I find that licensing increases women's hourly wage rates by 5.7% more than men's, thereby reducing the gender wage gap by 49%. The effect is more pronounced for higher-educated workers and those with young children. For licenses that involve additional human capital requirements such as continuing education, women benefit both directly through increased productivity and indirectly through enhanced signaling value. These benefits are particularly strong when temporal interruptions for women become widespread with the introduction of family leave policies. These findings support a model of statistical discrimination in which licensing serves as a signal of ability and labor force attachment.
