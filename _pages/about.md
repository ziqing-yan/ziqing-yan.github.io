Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Yale University. My research lies at the intersection of **Labor Economics** and **Macroeconomics**, with a focus on:
<ol>
<li>The effects of public policies and labor market regulations on <strong>gender inequality</strong>, and</li>
<li>The determinants of <strong>worker mobility</strong> and their implications for labor market outcomes.</li> 
</ol>

**I am on the 2025-2026 job market.**

        Occupational licensing covers one-fifth of the U.S. workforce and a quarter of female employment. This paper provides new causal evidence on its impact on the gender wage gap. Using individual-level data from the Current Population Survey and exploiting cross-state variation in licensing regulations within a two-way fixed effects framework, I find that licensing raises women’s wages by 3.7 percentage points more than men’s, narrowing the gender wage gap by 26 percent. To validate identification, I construct a novel dataset on the timing of state-occupation licensing reforms and estimate difference-in-difference models, which corroborate the baseline effect. The effect is strongest among unionized workers, college graduates, mothers, and workers at the top and bottom of the wage distribution. Guided by a model of statistical discrimination, I show that licensing can mitigate the gap by signaling ability when productivity is imperfectly observed. Additional requirements bundled with licenses, such as courses, exams, and continuing education, further reduce the gap through both signaling and human capital channels, with particularly pronounced effects in states with Paid Family and Medical Leave policies, where temporary labor force interruptions for women are more common.
